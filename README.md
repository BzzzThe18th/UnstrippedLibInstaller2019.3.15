THE BAT FILE MUST BE PLACED IN THE GORILLA TAG DIRECTORY TO FUNCTION

If you are on steam, the default path for your gorilla tag directory is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag"

If you do not know how to use that and are on steam, go to your steam library by pressing this button in the steam desktop app

Find gorilla tag and right click it, hover over "Manage" and click "Browse local files", this will open a file explorer window to your gorilla tag directory

On oculus pc the default oculus pc installation path is "C:\Program Files\Oculus", if that is the path, your gorilla tag directory path is "C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Downloads\Gorilla Tag"

Those are the ways to get the directory path of gorilla tag in order to place the mod fixer.
